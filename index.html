						<p>Portrayed by Guido Quaroni</p>
						<p>Guido is a light blue Alzo/Tutto Forklift from the Cars franchise. Like his best friend and boss Luigi, he is Italian. He is the employee and assistant of Luigi in the Casa Della Tires. Guido is the quickest tire changer in the West, and in the whole world and his life-dream is to change the tires of a real race car, especially if it's a Ferrari. He first debuted in the Pixar film, Cars from 2006 and has been a recurring character in the franchise.</p>

						<p>Like his friend Luigi, Guido is an avid Ferrari racing fan who dreams of performing a real pit stop on a real race car. He practices tire changes at night on a wooden frame he built in his garage. One day, he hopes to set a new world record for the fasted pit stop of all time. But until then, he hangs around the Casa Della Tires in Radiator Springs.</p>

						<p>When Lightning McQueen crashed into Radiator Springs, Guido knew his dream would come true. Not a Ferrari, but he was a rookie hotshot that needed a pit crew. When Lightning arrives at the 2006 Piston Cup, he is backed by his new pitcew with Doc Hudson as the leader of the group. At the Piston Cup, Guido is met with attitude from Chick Hicks' pitcrew members. Guido deals with this when he single-handledly changes Lightning McQueen's tires in record time. This was something even accomplished by four experienced pit crewman could do, causing Chick Hick's pitcrew members' mustaches to fall off.</p>

Luigi asked Guido to punch him, before collapsing on his side. Michael Ferrari then addressed Guido in Italian, causing Guido to fall over as well.</p>

						<p>After winning his fourth Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen returns to Radiator Springs and rejoins his friend Mater. While Lightning Mc Queen is at the Wheel Well Motel with Sally Carrera, Mater comes in and asks Guido what McQueen's usual is. Guido is seen serving drinks and doesn't know what McQueen's usual is. After Mater calls The Mel Dorado Show confronting F1 car Francesco Bernoulli, McQueen picks up the phone and joins the World Grand Prix. Guido is excited about this news because the Gran Prix will have a race in his home town, Italy. He may also see some Ferraris.</p>

"I don't need your help, I don't want your help," McQueen said to Mater hurting his feelings. Mater leaves behind a letter after going to the airport to go back home. While McQueen read the letter, Guido and Luigi would burst into tears making McQueen feel guilty for what he said.</p>

A big fight ensues and Guido helps fight the lemons by removing all four tires of two Gremlins in an instant.

Guido can be seen at the Radiator Springs Grand Prix, where the original racers from the World Grand Prix were gathered to have a friendly race around the town. Guido has a sign with the number 95 and a lightning bolt, representing Lightning McQueen. He is also wearing outlandish, red and orange wig.</p>

						<p>This race was different. As Lightning was about to finish the race, Jackson Storm, a next gen rookie, caught up and took the lead without breaking a sweat. He is made differently, trains differently, and doesn't have good sportsmanship. After constant failure, McQueen loses it and at rushes Guido at the pit. This did not let Guido change all the tires in time and left McQueen with one bad tire. This is what led to the big wreck for McQueen. After recovering, he stayed in confinement with only his primer. Until Sally convinces him to get back on the track and train. As McQueen was going to call Rusty and Dusty, they tell him that they are making a new facility. This one will have a better simulator than Jackson Storm. Lightning, Luigi and Guido visit the new and improved Rust-Eze facility. Guido does not like the paparazzi.</p>

Guido helped disguise McQueen with mud and gave him a fake number and a fake name, Chester Whipplefilter.</p>

When Guido was going to change his tire, Lightning refuses and tell him to put the tires on Cruz. She enters the race with the number 95 painted by Ramone and finishes first place.

						<h3>Spinning</h3>
						<p>Guido is told to hold a sign in front of the Casa Della Tires. When Luigi leaves, Guido starts to experiment and spins the sign around. Lightning McQueen notices and tells everyone to look at Guido. Soon, a crowd of cars were there to watch Guido, including a DJ. Guido begins to dance while the DJ starts playing music. At the end, Guido throws the sign to high in the air and catches it while balancing on two tires and says, "Pit stop." Everyone cheers and leaves. Guido then starts to daydream until Luigi, who didn't see Guido, comes back and tells him to shake the sign.</p>
